## 🚀 GO/NO-GO Decision

### **DECISION: 🟢 CONDITIONAL GO**

**Deploy application layer immediately while resolving infrastructure issues in parallel**

### Deployment Strategy: **Phased Approach**

#### Phase 1: Application Pilot (Immediate - 1-3 days)
- **Action:** Deploy Serenity AWS application on existing development infrastructure
- **Scope:** 10-20 pilot users (patients + providers + supporters)
- **Duration:** 2-3 weeks user acceptance testing
- **Risk:** Low - Application fully validated and tested
- **Monitoring:** Manual validation with documented procedures

#### Phase 2: Infrastructure Resolution (Parallel - 1-2 weeks)
- **Action:** Resolve AWS CloudFormation permissions for production CDK deployment
- **Alternative:** Implement Terraform as primary infrastructure deployment method
- **Outcome:** Production-grade infrastructure ready for scale-up
- **Timeline:** Complete before pilot expansion

#### Phase 3: Production Migration (3-4 weeks)
- **Action:** Migrate successful pilot to production infrastructure
- **Scope:** Expand to full user base based on pilot feedback
- **Requirements:** All infrastructure issues resolved
- **Success Criteria:** Zero-downtime migration with full monitoring
