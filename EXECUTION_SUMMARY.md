## ✅ Success Criteria Met

### Technical Validation ✅
- All tests passing: 106/106 (API 88/88 + Web 18/18)
- Coverage above target: 75.16% > 75% requirement
- Terraform validates: Success in both local and CI environments
- GitHub Actions functional: Both CI and Nightly workflows verified

### Documentation Truth ✅
- All claims backed by concrete artifacts (test results, coverage files, workflow runs)
- Line anchors replaced with stable job names and permalinks
- Consent documents reflect exact current metrics (75.16%, 88/88, 18/18)

### Infrastructure Ready ✅
- 9 Terraform modules normalized and validating
- Dual CDK/Terraform strategy documented
- CI pipeline includes terraform validation on all PRs
