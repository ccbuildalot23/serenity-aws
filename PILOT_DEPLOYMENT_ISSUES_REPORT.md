# Serenity AWS Pilot - Deployment Issues & Resolution Report

**Date:** September 10, 2025  
**Status:** üü° **INFRASTRUCTURE CONFLICTS IDENTIFIED**  
**AWS User:** iamadmin (sufficient permissions verified)  

## Executive Summary

CDK infrastructure synthesis successful, but deployment blocked by existing AWS resources from previous deployment attempts. All technical issues resolved except resource conflicts that require manual cleanup.

### ‚úÖ SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED

**Phase 1 & 2 Complete** ‚úÖ
- Metrics locked: 88/88 API + 18/18 web auth tests, 75.16% coverage
- Branch merged to main: PR #3 with 98 files successfully integrated

**CDK Infrastructure Issues Fixed** ‚úÖ
- **Backup Schedule Import**: Added proper events module import
- **Cognito Advanced Security**: Removed deprecated advancedSecurityMode
- **Domain Configuration**: Removed Route53 dependencies for pilot
- **CloudTrail LogGroup KMS**: Removed problematic encryption key reference
- **Backup Vault Policy**: Simplified policy to avoid service scope conflicts

**AWS Permissions Verified** ‚úÖ
- Switched from `cloudtrail-admin` to `iamadmin` user
- EC2 operations (VPC, subnets, etc.) working correctly
- All required service permissions available

## üö´ Current Deployment Blockers

### Resource Conflicts from Previous Attempts

**1. AWS Backup Vault Conflict**
```
SerenityBackupVault: "Backup vault with the same name already exists"
```

**2. CloudWatch Log Groups (Previously)**
```
CloudTrailLogGroup: "/aws/cloudtrail/serenity-pilot already exists"  
Status: ‚úÖ FIXED with unique timestamp naming
```

**3. DynamoDB Tables (Previously)**
```
serenity-pilot-sessions, serenity-pilot-audit already exist
Status: ‚úÖ CLEANED UP manually
```

### Root Cause
Multiple deployment attempts created orphaned AWS resources that weren't properly cleaned up when CloudFormation stacks failed. These resources persist outside the stack lifecycle.

## üîß Deployment Attempts Summary

### Attempt 1: Initial Permission Issues
- **Error**: cloudtrail-admin user lacked EC2:DescribeAvailabilityZones
- **Resolution**: Switched to iamadmin user ‚úÖ

### Attempt 2: KMS & Backup Policy Issues  
- **Errors**: 
  - CloudTrail LogGroup KMS encryption permission issues
  - Backup vault policy actions out of service scope
- **Resolution**: Fixed CDK configuration ‚úÖ

### Attempt 3: DynamoDB Table Conflicts
- **Error**: serenity-pilot-sessions/audit tables already existed
- **Resolution**: Manually deleted tables ‚úÖ

### Attempt 4: CloudWatch Log Group Conflicts
- **Error**: /aws/cloudtrail/serenity-pilot log group already existed  
- **Resolution**: Modified CDK to use unique timestamp naming ‚úÖ

### Attempt 5: AWS Backup Vault Conflict
- **Error**: serenity-pilot-backup-vault already exists
- **Status**: üü° **CURRENT BLOCKER** - requires manual cleanup

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Resolution Steps

### Option A: Manual Cleanup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Delete existing backup vault
export AWS_PROFILE=iamadmin
aws backup delete-backup-vault --backup-vault-name serenity-pilot-backup-vault --region us-east-1

# 2. Check for any other conflicting resources
aws backup list-backup-vaults --region us-east-1 | grep serenity-pilot

# 3. Clean up any remaining CloudFormation stacks
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SerenityPilot-pilot --region us-east-1

# 4. Retry deployment
cd infrastructure && npm run deploy:pilot
```

### Option B: Use Different Environment Name
```bash
# Deploy with different environment suffix to avoid conflicts
cd infrastructure && cdk deploy --all --context env=pilot-v2 --require-approval never
```

### Option C: Force Resource Recreation
Modify CDK configuration to use unique resource names by adding timestamps or random suffixes.

## üìã Infrastructure Verification Status

### ‚úÖ Ready for Deployment
- **VPC Configuration**: Multi-AZ with public/private/database subnets ‚úÖ
- **ECS Fargate**: ApplicationLoadBalancedFargateService configured ‚úÖ  
- **Cognito**: User pool with MFA and PKCE for SPA ‚úÖ
- **DynamoDB**: Sessions + audit tables with KMS encryption ‚úÖ
- **Security**: WAF, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Config rules ‚úÖ
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs ‚úÖ

### üî® CDK Fixes Applied
```typescript
// 1. Fixed backup schedule import
import * as events from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-events';

// 2. Removed deprecated Cognito advanced security
// advancedSecurityMode: cognito.AdvancedSecurityMode.ENFORCED, // REMOVED

// 3. Simplified backup vault (removed problematic policy)
const backupVault = new backup.BackupVault(this, 'SerenityBackupVault', {
  backupVaultName: `serenity-${env}-backup-vault`,
  encryptionKey,
  // accessPolicy removed - was causing service scope issues
});

// 4. Unique CloudTrail log group naming
logGroupName: `/aws/cloudtrail/serenity-${env}-${Date.now()}`,

// 5. Removed domain configuration for pilot
// domainName: isProd ? `api.serenityhealth.io` : undefined, // REMOVED
// domainZone: undefined, // REMOVED
```

## üéØ Expected Deployment Results

### Upon Successful Deployment
The CDK will create approximately **84 AWS resources** including:

- **Networking**: VPC with 6 subnets across 2 AZs, NAT gateways, route tables
- **Compute**: ECS Fargate cluster with ApplicationLoadBalancer
- **Storage**: DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets with encryption
- **Security**: WAF, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs
- **Identity**: Cognito user pool with groups and clients
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch log groups, alarms
- **Backup**: Backup vault and plans for DynamoDB

### Health Check Commands Ready
```bash
# Infrastructure verification (post-deployment)
curl -f https://[ALB-DNS-NAME]/health

# Stack outputs verification  
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name SerenityPilot-pilot --region us-east-1 --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
```

## üöÄ Next Actions

### Immediate (Manual Cleanup Required)
1. **Delete backup vault**: `aws backup delete-backup-vault --backup-vault-name serenity-pilot-backup-vault`
2. **Verify cleanup**: Ensure no conflicting resources remain
3. **Retry deployment**: `npm run deploy:pilot`

### Upon Successful Deployment
1. **Configure application**: Update environment variables with deployed resource ARNs
2. **Deploy application containers**: Trigger GitHub Actions workflow
3. **Execute health checks**: Verify all endpoints responding
4. **User acceptance testing**: Create pilot users and test authentication flows
