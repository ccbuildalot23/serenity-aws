## Security Considerations

### Threat Mitigation

**Session Hijacking Prevention:**
- Automatic timeout prevents abandoned session exploitation
- Activity monitoring detects unusual session patterns
- Complete PHI cleanup on timeout prevents data exposure

**Data Breach Prevention:**
- AES-256-GCM encryption exceeds HIPAA minimum requirements
- Authenticated encryption prevents tampering
- Key derivation uses industry-standard PBKDF2 with high iterations

**Insider Threat Detection:**
- Complete audit logging tracks all PHI access
- Real-time alerting on suspicious activities
- Statistical analysis enables behavioral anomaly detection

**Technical Attack Prevention:**
- Web Crypto API prevents key exposure to JavaScript
- Network request monitoring blocks accidental PHI transmission
- Cross-browser testing ensures consistent security behavior

### Known Limitations

1. **JavaScript Memory Limitations:** While we attempt to clear sensitive data from memory, JavaScript's garbage collection makes complete memory clearing impossible. This is mitigated by using native crypto APIs where possible.

2. **LocalStorage Testing:** Production systems should use secure, server-side audit logging. LocalStorage is used only for testing and development.

3. **Browser Compatibility:** Web Crypto API requires modern browsers (IE11+ not supported). This aligns with healthcare industry standard browser requirements.

4. **Mobile App Store Review:** Screen capture protection features may require additional native implementation for mobile app deployment.
