## Executive Summary

Research into solo developer git workflows for HIPAA-compliant healthcare startups reveals that **trunk-based development with feature flags** is the optimal strategy for balancing rapid iteration with regulatory compliance. This approach enables single developers to maintain audit trails while maximizing development speed.

## Key Research Findings

### 1. Optimal Git Strategy for Solo Healthcare Developers

**Recommended Approach: Simplified Trunk-Based Development**
- Single production-ready `main` branch with automated deployments
- Short-lived feature branches (1-3 days maximum)
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts of PHI-related features
- Immediate hotfix capabilities for security patches

**Benefits for Healthcare Startups:**
- Minimizes merge conflicts and complexity
- Enables rapid iteration for 90-day MVP timelines
- Maintains comprehensive audit trails required for HIPAA
- Supports gradual feature rollouts critical for PHI-handling features
- Simplifies compliance documentation for investor due diligence

### 2. HIPAA Compliance Requirements for Solo Developers

**Minimum Technical Safeguards Required:**
- **Access Control**: GitHub branch protection + 2FA enforcement
- **Audit Controls**: Comprehensive logging for all repository activities
- **Data Integrity**: Never store PHI in git repositories
- **Transmission Security**: Enforce HTTPS/SSH for all git operations

**Critical Implementation Details:**
```yaml
# Minimum branch protection for HIPAA compliance
protection_rules:
  main:
    required_status_checks: true
    enforce_admins: true
    required_pull_request_reviews:
      required_approving_review_count: 1 # Self-review documentation
    allow_force_pushes: false
    allow_deletions: false
```

**Self-Review Process for PHI-Related Changes:**
- Detailed pull request templates with HIPAA checklists
- Security impact assessments for all data-handling code
- Automated security scanning with CodeQL
- Change logs linking commits to compliance requirements
- 6-year retention requirement for all git history

### 3. Cost-Effective CI/CD for Solo Developers

**GitHub Actions (Recommended for Healthcare):**
- **Free Tier**: 2,000 minutes/month for private repositories
- **Cost**: $0.008/minute after free tier
- **Healthcare Benefits**: Native security scanning, AWS integration, secrets management

**Cost Optimization Strategies:**
- Self-hosted runners on AWS Spot instances (77% cost savings)
- Efficient caching strategies to reduce build times
- Run tests only on changed files
- Nightly/weekly security scans vs. every commit

**Alternative Options Evaluated:**
- CircleCI: 6,000 build minutes/month free
- AWS CodePipeline: $1/pipeline/month
- Azure DevOps: 1,800 minutes/month free

**Projected Monthly CI/CD Costs:**
- Development phase: $0-50/month
- Production with monitoring: $100-200/month
- Team scaling (5 developers): $300-500/month

### 4. Solo Developer Self-Review Best Practices

**Automated Compliance Checklist:**
```markdown
## HIPAA Compliance Self-Review
- [ ] No PHI data in code, comments, or test files
- [ ] All API endpoints require proper authentication
- [ ] Audit logging implemented for data access
- [ ] Encryption at rest and in transit verified
- [ ] Session timeout (15 minutes) enforced for PHI access
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Database queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] Third-party integrations have valid BAAs
```

**Essential Tools for Solo Review:**
- **SonarQube Community**: Free code quality analysis
- **GitHub CodeQL**: Free security scanning
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Common security issue detection
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Vulnerable dependency identification

### 5. Scaling Preparation for Team Growth

**Day-One Implementation for Future Scaling:**
- Standardized commit messages (conventional commits)
- Automated testing with 90% minimum coverage
- Security scanning on every commit
- Documentation requirements for all changes
- Role-based access controls ready for team expansion

**Repository Structure for Scaling:**
```
