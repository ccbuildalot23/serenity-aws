## Executive Summary

This document establishes streamlined git workflow standards optimized for a solo developer building the Serenity AWS mental health platform. These standards balance rapid development speed with HIPAA compliance requirements while preparing for future team scaling and investor technical due diligence.

## Strategic Business Context

### October Pilot Launch Readiness
- **Rapid Development**: Streamlined workflows enable 90-day MVP timeline
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Minimum viable compliance for healthcare applications
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized CI/CD reduces operational expenses during seed stage
- **Investor Confidence**: Professional practices demonstrate operational maturity

### Solo Developer Advantages
- **Minimal Friction**: Reduced bureaucracy maximizes development velocity
- **Direct Accountability**: Clear ownership of all code and compliance decisions
- **Rapid Iteration**: Immediate implementation of security fixes and features
- **Foundation Building**: Processes scale seamlessly when team grows

---

## Solo Developer Adaptations

### Core Philosophy
**"Compliance without Complexity"** - Maintain all HIPAA requirements while eliminating unnecessary process overhead typical of larger teams.

### Key Simplifications
- **Single Reviewer**: Self-review with automated compliance checking
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Eliminate complex branching strategies
- **Automated Gates**: Replace manual processes with automated validation
- **Cost-Optimized CI/CD**: Nightly compliance scans to reduce build costs

---

## Git Configuration Standards

### Developer Environment Setup
```bash
# Prevent line ending issues (already implemented)
git config core.autocrlf false
git config core.filemode false

# Solo developer optimizations
git config pull.rebase false
git config push.default simple

# HIPAA compliance requirements
git config commit.gpgsign true
git config user.signingkey [YOUR-GPG-KEY-ID]

# Identity for audit trails
git config user.name "Your Full Name"
git config user.email "your.email@serenityaws.com"
```

### Repository Configuration (Implemented)
- **`.gitattributes`**: âœ… Enforces LF line endings and file type handling
- **`.editorconfig`**: âœ… Ensures consistent code formatting across IDEs
- **`.gitignore`**: âœ… Prevents sensitive files from being committed

---

## Simplified Branch Strategy

### Trunk-Based Development Model

```
main (production-ready, always deployable)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/quick-fixes (1-3 days max)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/new-functionality (1-3 days max)
â””â”€â”€ hotfix/security-patches (immediate deployment)
```

### Branch Rules (Solo Developer)
- **Main Branch**: Always production-ready, protected from force pushes
- **Feature Branches**: Short-lived (1-3 days maximum), deleted after merge
- **Hotfix Branches**: Immediate security or critical bug fixes
- **No Long-Running Branches**: Eliminates merge conflicts and complexity

### Branch Protection Policies

#### Main Branch (Production)
```yaml
protection_rules:
  main:
    required_status_checks: 
      - continuous-integration
      - security-scan-basic
    enforce_admins: true
    required_pull_request_reviews:
      required_approving_review_count: 0  # Solo developer exception
    allow_force_pushes: false
    allow_deletions: false
    dismiss_stale_reviews: false
```

#### Feature Branches
- **Automatic Deletion**: Enabled after merge
- **Required Checks**: Lint, typecheck, unit tests only
- **Fast Merge**: No review requirements for non-PHI changes

---

## Commit Standards & HIPAA Compliance

### Simplified Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

[HIPAA-Impact: LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH] (if PHI-related)
[PHI-Access: READ|WRITE|ADMIN] (if applicable)

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
```

### Solo Developer Commit Types
- **feat**: New feature or functionality
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **security**: Security-related changes (requires HIPAA review)
- **hipaa**: HIPAA compliance updates (requires documentation)
- **chore**: Maintenance, dependencies, tooling
- **docs**: Documentation updates

### PHI-Related Commit Requirements
For commits that touch PHI-handling code:
```bash
security(auth): implement 15-minute PHI session timeout

Add automated session expiration for PHI access endpoints to ensure
compliance with healthcare data security requirements.

HIPAA-Impact: HIGH
PHI-Access: ADMIN
Self-Review: Completed with security checklist
Compliance-Check: PASSED

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
```

## Solo Developer Self-Review Process

### Automated Compliance Checklist
Create this checklist template for all PHI-related changes:

```markdown
## HIPAA Compliance Self-Review Checklist
- [ ] No PHI data in code, comments, or test files
- [ ] All API endpoints require proper authentication
- [ ] Audit logging implemented for PHI data access
- [ ] Encryption at rest and in transit verified
- [ ] Session timeout (15 minutes) enforced for PHI access
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Database queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] Third-party integrations have valid BAAs
- [ ] Security scanning results reviewed and clean
- [ ] Change documented with business justification
```

### Review Tools (Automated)
- **GitHub CodeQL**: Free security scanning (already enabled)
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Catches common security issues
- **SonarQube Community**: Code quality analysis
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Vulnerable dependency detection

### Documentation Requirements
- Link PHI-related commits to compliance requirements
- Maintain security impact assessments for major changes
- Document all third-party integrations with BAA status
- Create audit trails for all deployment activities

## Cost-Optimized CI/CD Pipeline

### Current Configuration (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/solo-developer-ci.yml
name: Solo Developer HIPAA-Compliant CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, feature/* ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  # Fast checks on every push
  quick-validation:

## Workflow Processes (Solo Developer)

### Feature Development Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/patient-dashboard-analytics
   ```

2. **Development with Self-Review**
   - Implement feature with TDD approach
   - Run automated tests and linting locally
   - Complete HIPAA checklist for PHI-related changes
   - Document security considerations

3. **Pre-Merge Validation**
   ```bash
   # Local validation
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   npm run test
   npm run security:quick
   
   # Push and validate CI
   git push origin feature/patient-dashboard-analytics
   ```

4. **Merge Process**
   - Create pull request with self-review documentation
   - Wait for automated CI validation
   - Merge to main after all checks pass
   - Delete feature branch automatically

### Hotfix Process (Security Focused)

1. **Immediate Response**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch-auth
   ```

2. **Emergency Fix Implementation**
   - Implement minimal change to address security issue
   - Include comprehensive test coverage
   - Document security implications thoroughly

3. **Expedited Deployment**
   - Push directly to main after local validation
   - Monitor deployment with enhanced logging
   - Document incident and resolution for audit trail

```javascript
// Automated audit logging
const auditEntry = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  developer: process.env.GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL,
  action: 'commit',
  repository: 'serenity-aws',
  branch: 'feature/phi-data-access',
  commit: process.env.GITHUB_SHA,
  files: ['src/routes/patient.routes.ts'],
  phiImpact: 'HIGH',
  complianceStatus: 'VALIDATED',
  reviewStatus: 'SELF_REVIEWED'
};
```

### PHI Change Management (Solo Developer)
