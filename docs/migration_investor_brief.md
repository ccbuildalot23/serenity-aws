# Migration to AWS: Strategic Investor Brief

## Executive Summary

Serenity is migrating from Supabase to AWS to demonstrate enterprise-grade scalability, compliance readiness, and alignment with healthcare industry standards. This strategic move positions us for rapid growth and enterprise customer acquisition.

## Why AWS Over Supabase

### 1. **Enterprise Trust & Market Validation**
- **92% of healthcare organizations** use AWS for HIPAA-compliant workloads
- AWS holds **$2.4 billion in healthcare contracts** including with HHS, VA, and major hospital systems
- Supabase, while innovative, lacks the enterprise validation required for healthcare sales

### 2. **Scalability & Performance**
- **AWS Auto-scaling**: Handle 10x patient load spikes during crisis events
- **Global infrastructure**: 31 regions vs Supabase's limited regions
- **99.99% uptime SLA** for critical healthcare services

### 3. **HIPAA & Compliance Excellence**
- **AWS BAA**: Covers 130+ services vs Supabase's limited BAA scope
- **FedRAMP authorized**: Opens federal healthcare contracts
- **SOC 1/2/3, ISO 27001**: Complete compliance certification stack

## Financial Impact
