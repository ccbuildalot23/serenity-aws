## Verification Commands

### Run All Tests
```bash
# API tests with coverage
cd apps/api && npm run test:cov
# Expected: 87/87 tests passing, 75.16% coverage

# Web auth tests
cd apps/web-phase2 && npm test -- src/app/api/auth/**/*.test.ts  
# Expected: 18/18 tests passing

# Start development environment
npm run dev
# Expected: API on :3001, Frontend on :3000
```

### Infrastructure Validation
```bash
# Terraform validation (requires terraform installation)
cd terraform && terraform init && terraform validate
# Expected: Configuration is valid

# Check module structure
find terraform/modules -name "*.tf" | wc -l
# Expected: 27 files (9 modules Ã— 3 files each)
```

---

## Deployment Commands

### Pilot Infrastructure Deployment
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your AWS account details
terraform plan -out=pilot.plan
terraform apply pilot.plan
```

### Application Deployment
```bash
# Build applications
npm run build

# Deploy API (after infrastructure)
cd apps/api && npm run deploy:pilot

# Deploy frontend (after infrastructure)  
cd apps/web-phase2 && npm run deploy:pilot
```
