1. **Assessments**: Clinical robustness → Provider confidence → Higher retention
2. **Crisis Detection**: Automatic escalation → Reduced liability → Provider peace of mind
3. **Progress Tracking**: Longitudinal data → Better outcomes → Justifies ROI
4. **Client-side Processing**: Privacy-first → HIPAA compliance → Enterprise ready

## 📋 Next Week (Week 8) Plan

### Priority 1: Provider Dashboard (Day 1-2)
- [ ] ROI Metrics Component ($4.5-9k highlighted)
- [ ] CPT Billing Tracker
- [ ] Patient Trends Visualization
- [ ] Revenue Per Patient Calculator

### Priority 2: Pricing Simulator (Day 3)
- [ ] Three-tier comparison (Professional/Practice/Enterprise)
- [ ] Break-even analysis (3 patients = covered)
- [ ] Interactive ROI calculator

### Priority 3: Dual AI Chat (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Mode toggle (Peer vs Clinical)
- [ ] Safety disclaimers
- [ ] Crisis detection keywords
- [ ] Mock responses initially

### Priority 4: Supporter Portal (Day 5)
- [ ] Privacy-preserving alerts
- [ ] Acknowledgment tracking
- [ ] Audit logging

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **SurveyJS Integration Complexity**: Fallback to existing simple forms if needed
2. **Lambda Not Ready**: Using comprehensive mock data
3. **Cognito Delays**: Simple JWT auth as temporary solution

### Mitigation Actions
- All components have mock data fallbacks
- Error boundaries prevent crashes
- Progressive enhancement approach

## 💰 Financial Impact

### Cost Analysis
- **Incremental Costs**: <$100/month
  - Lambda calls: ~$50/month
  - S3 storage: ~$25/month
  - SurveyJS: Free (MIT license)

### ROI Visibility
- Break-even: 3 patients/month
- Target: Show ROI in <10 seconds on dashboard
- Upsell path: Clear at 50+ patients

## 🏥 Clinical Validation Status

### Ready for Review
- [x] GAD-7 wording and thresholds
- [x] AUDIT risk categorization
