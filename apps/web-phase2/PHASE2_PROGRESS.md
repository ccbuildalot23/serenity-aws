# Phase 2 Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed (Day 1 - Part 1)

### Core Infrastructure (30% → 35%)
1. **Project Setup** - Next.js 15 app with TypeScript, Tailwind, Zustand ✅
2. **API Client** - Complete with interceptors and error handling ✅
3. **State Management** - Zustand store with persistence ✅
4. **Layout Component** - Role-based navigation ✅

### Patient Features (40% → 55%)
1. **Daily Check-in Page** - 5-step form with mood, sleep, triggers ✅
2. **PHQ-9 Assessment** - Complete with scoring and crisis detection ✅
3. **GAD-7 Assessment** - With client-side scoring, crisis escalation at score ≥15 ✅
4. **AUDIT Assessment** - With risk levels, crisis escalation at score ≥20 ✅

### Key Enhancements Applied
- **Privacy Protection**: Client-side assessment scoring (no PHI in transit)
- **Crisis Escalation**: Automatic alerts for high scores (GAD-7 ≥15, AUDIT ≥20)
- **Longitudinal Tracking**: Saves assessment history for trend analysis
- **Clinical Disclaimers**: Clear guidance on what scores mean

## 📋 Next Immediate Tasks

### Continue Day 1 Implementation:
1. **Create Assessments Listing Page** (1 hour)
   - `/app/patient/assessments/page.tsx`
   - Grid layout showing all available assessments
   - Last completion date and scores

2. **Copy & Adapt Dual AI Chat** (2 hours)
   - `/components/ai/DualAIChat.tsx`
   - Clear distinction between peer/clinical modes
   - Mock responses initially

3. **Build Provider Dashboard** (3 hours)
   - `/app/provider/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - ROI metrics display
   - CPT code tracking
   - Patient overview cards

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /c/dev/serenity-aws/apps/web-phase2

# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔑 Key Files Created Today

1. **Assessments:**
   - `src/components/assessments/PHQ9Assessment.tsx`
   - `src/components/assessments/GAD7Assessment.tsx`
   - `src/components/assessments/AUDITAssessment.tsx`

2. **Core Components:**
   - `src/components/Layout.tsx`
   - `src/app/patient/check-in/page.tsx`

3. **Infrastructure:**
   - `src/lib/api-client.ts`
   - `src/lib/utils.ts`
   - `src/store/useStore.ts`

## 🎯 Success Metrics Tracking

✅ **Achieved:**
- Client-side assessment processing (privacy)
- Crisis escalation thresholds implemented
- Longitudinal data capture ready
- BMAD approach followed (no overengineering)

🔄 **In Progress:**
- Provider dashboard with ROI
- Dual AI chat interface
- Supporter portal

📅 **Upcoming:**
- AWS Cognito integration
- Jest/Playwright tests
- Vercel deployment

## 💡 Technical Decisions Made

1. **No Complex Dependencies**: Removed ui/card, complex hooks
2. **Simple State Management**: Using Zustand, not Redux
3. **Mock First**: Using mock data, will connect to Lambda later
4. **Client-Side Privacy**: Scores calculated locally, only results sent
5. **Research-Validated Thresholds**: GAD-7 ≥15, AUDIT ≥20 for crisis

## 🔧 Environment Variables Needed

Add these to `.env.local` when ready:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_USER_POOL_ID=your-pool-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_USER_POOL_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_GATEWAY_URL=your-api-url
```

## 📝 Notes for Clinical Review

The following components need clinical advisor review:
1. GAD-7 severity thresholds and recommendations
2. AUDIT risk level categorization
3. Crisis escalation triggers
4. AI response templates (when implemented)
