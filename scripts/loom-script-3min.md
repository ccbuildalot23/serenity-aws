## SCRIPT (Read this word-for-word)

### Opening (0:00-0:20) 
*[Start on demo page, camera on]*

"Hi [Provider Name], I'm Christopher from Serenity Health. 

I'm 33 days into recovery, and therapists like you saved my life. Now I want to give you your nights and weekends back.

Let me show you exactly how our crisis system works - this is live, not a simulation."

### Crisis Demo (0:20-1:20)
*[Switch to terminal]*

"Here's what happens when one of your patients has a crisis at 2 AM on Saturday.

Watch my phone here..."

*[Trigger the demo - press ENTER]*

"Sarah Johnson, 45 days clean, just triggered a crisis alert in Arlington.

The system is now notifying her support network..."

*[Point to phone as SMS arrives]*

"There it is - under 3 seconds. Her counselor, sponsor, and emergency contact all get notified instantly.

*[Show the SMS on phone]*

Look at this - GPS location, her days clean, one-tap response. No one has to be on-call. The support network handles it.

If no one responds in 30 seconds, it escalates to the next tier automatically."

### Billing Automation (1:20-2:00)
*[Switch to browser - demo page]*

"But here's what really pays for this and then some...

*[Click on Billing Automation tab]*

Every session you document, our AI finds the CPT codes you're missing.

*[Click Generate CPT Codes button]*

Look - 90834 for the therapy, 99490 for care coordination, 90785 for complexity. That's $225 you probably didn't bill.

With 50 patients on care coordination alone, that's $2,800 per month you're leaving on the table. 

Medicare and Medicaid pay for this. You're already doing the work. Now you'll get paid for it."

### Time Savings (2:00-2:40)
*[Stay on demo page, click Documentation tab]*

"And documentation? Watch this.

Instead of typing for 20 minutes after each session, you just talk for 60 seconds.

*[Click microphone icon or describe it]*

'Patient showed improvement in mood, discussed coping strategies for work stress, practiced mindfulness, will continue weekly sessions.'

Done. SOAP note created. HIPAA compliant. Integrated with SimplePractice.

That's 2 hours every single day you get back. Time to see more patients, or better yet, time to live your life."

### Call to Action (2:40-3:00)
*[Back to camera, full screen if possible]*

"Look, I'm only taking 5 Virginia practices for this free pilot. Three spots are already claimed.

It takes 15 minutes to set up. I'll personally onboard you.

Text me right now at 240-419-9375. Or grab a time at [show calendar link].

Let's give you your nights back and help more people stay in recovery.

Talk soon."

*[End recording]*

## Backup Lines (If You Mess Up)

**If demo fails:**
"Let me show you what this looks like..." [switch to backup video]

**If SMS doesn't arrive:**
"It typically arrives in 3 seconds, but let me show you the dashboard view..."

**If you forget what to say:**
"The bottom line is this: you save 10 hours a week, capture $2,800 in missed billing, and never take another crisis call at 2 AM."
