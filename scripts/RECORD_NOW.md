## üìù YOUR EXACT SCRIPT (Say this!)

### Opening
"Hi, I'm Christopher from Serenity Health. I'm 33 days into recovery, and therapists like you saved my life. Now I want to give you your nights back. Watch what happens when a patient has a crisis..."

### During SMS Demo
"There it is - 3 seconds! GPS location, days clean, one-tap response. No one's on call. The support network handles it."

### Billing Section
"But here's what pays for this - every session, we find CPT codes you're missing. That's $2,800 per month with 50 patients."

### Closing
"I'm only taking 5 Virginia practices. Text me: 240-419-9375. Let's give you your nights back."

## üö® IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

**SMS doesn't arrive?**
Say: "It typically arrives instantly, let me show you the dashboard view..." and switch to the web demo.

**Script crashes?**
Say: "Let me show you how this works..." and manually demonstrate on the web interface.

**Forget your lines?**
Default to: "Bottom line - save 10 hours a week, make $2,800 more per month, never take a 2 AM crisis call again."
