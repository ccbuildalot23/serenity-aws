## Call Script (If They Reply YES)

```
"Hi [Name], this is Christopher from Serenity. Thanks for responding!

I'll keep this quick - I know your time is valuable.

I built a platform that does three things:
1. Turns your voice into compliant clinical notes in 60 seconds
2. Automatically generates CPT codes you're probably missing - worth about $2,800/month
3. Gives your patients 24/7 crisis support without you being on call

Takes 15 minutes to set up, integrates with SimplePractice, and it's free through December for our pilot.

Can I show you a 10-minute demo? I can screen share right now, or we can schedule for later today.

[If yes]: Perfect! Let me share my screen...

[If needs to schedule]: What time works best? I have [give 3 specific times]

[If hesitant]: I totally understand. Can I send you a 2-minute video showing exactly how it works? Then you can decide if it's worth your time.

## Response Handlers

### "Too expensive"
"It's completely free through December, and after that it pays for itself with just one hour of recovered billable time per week. Plus, you're currently missing about $2,800/month in care coordination billing that we automatically capture."

### "No time to learn new system"
"Setup takes 15 minutes. I personally do it for you. Training is one 10-minute video. Then it saves you 2 hours every single day. When can I give you those 2 hours back?"

### "Already have an EHR"
"Perfect! We integrate with SimplePractice/TherapyNotes. No double entry. We just add the features they don't have: voice documentation, crisis support, and finding missed billing codes."

### "Need to think about it"
"Of course. While you're thinking, your competitors are saving 10 hours a week and billing an extra $2,800/month. Can I follow up tomorrow, or would Thursday be better?"
